# Fishing Gadget
Code for a Raspi based fishing gadget writen in Python. The goal of this project is to be a replacement for the standard depth/fish finder that is found on most all fishing boats. The gadget has three main functions. The first is that it read inputs from peripheral GPS, water depth and temperature, and atmospheric sensors and uses that data to continuously update a UI where the information is displayed. Secondly, the gadget will compare GPS location and water depth to create a contoured depth map of the body of water you are fishing. Lastly, the gadget will record the conditions whenever you catch a fish so you can create a log of all of the fish you catch. Using the data in the log, an algorithm will compare the current conditions read by the peripheral sensors and suggest a fishing spot, depth, and/or species to target.
